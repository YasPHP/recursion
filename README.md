# recursion
A bunch o' recursion problemos.

The problems include:

- The Tower of Hanoi: a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
