# recursion
A bunch o' recursion problemos.

The problems include:

- The Tower of Hanoi: a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

- The Fibonnaci Sequence: The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

- Triangular Sequence: A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. 

- Nth Summing of Natural Numbers: Sum of natural numbers up to the <n> indicated.
  
- Reverse-r: Reverses a word's order.

- Counter: Counts the number of characters there are in a word.

- Total Summing of Numbers: Sums all the numbers in a list.

- Geometric Sequence: Generates a subsequent geometric sequence of a specific length generated from a starting point combined with a common-ratio multiplier.

- List Flattener: Converts a nested list to a flattened, non-nested list.
